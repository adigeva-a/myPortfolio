      <div class="sec-label">Background &amp; Context</div>
      <h2 class="sec-title">A regulatory mandate with no playbook</h2>
      <p class="sec-text">The EU's PSD2 directive and UK Open Banking standards mandated that banks expose their payment and account data through secure, standardized APIs by hard regulatory deadlines. Non-compliance meant significant fines. The problem: most banks had no internal API infrastructure, no Open Banking expertise, and no clear path to compliance.</p>
      <p class="sec-text" style="margin-top:.75rem">Finastra's opportunity was to build the platform that banks could adopt to meet these mandates — turning a regulatory burden into a product. As Senior Product Owner, I led the platform from conception to enterprise bank enablement over four years.</p>
      <p class="sec-text" style="margin-top:.75rem">This was a fundamentally different kind of product challenge: the customer was enterprises (banks), the user was third-party providers (TPPs) consuming the APIs, and the regulator was setting the requirements. Balancing all three simultaneously was the central challenge of the role.</p>

      <h2 class="sec-title">What 4 years of regulated B2B product ownership taught me</h2>
      <div class="two-col">
        <ul class="learnings">
          <li class="l-item">Regulatory constraints are product requirements — not obstacles. The discipline of working within hard constraints produces more creative, focused product decisions than open-ended briefs</li>
          <li class="l-item">Enterprise B2B PMs must speak both legal and engineering. The ability to translate between them is the core skill — and the rarest one on a product team</li>
          <li class="l-item">Developer experience is a product metric on API platforms. Swagger quality and sandbox reliability predicted TPP adoption far better than API feature completeness</li>
          <li class="l-item">Requirements traceability isn't overhead — it's essential. In regulated products, you need to explain every product decision to auditors and legal teams. Documenting the why at the time it's made saves enormous effort later</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="learnings">
          <li class="l-item">Pilot programs with real customers find what internal testing can't. Our bank beta participants discovered integration gaps in 3 weeks that 6 months of internal QA had missed</li>
          <li class="l-item">Platform metrics differ from consumer metrics. Reliability, adoption velocity, and time-to-activation matter more than individual user experience moments</li>
          <li class="l-item">Regulatory ambiguity is a product design opportunity. When the regulator's guidance is unclear, the bank that offers a clear, reasonable interpretation first wins market share</li>
          <li class="l-item">B2B PM timelines are dictated by external events (regulatory deadlines, customer contract milestones). Building buffers and being ruthless about scope is survival, not preference</li>
