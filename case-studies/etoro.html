      <h2 class="sec-title">New domain, new mandate</h2>
      <p class="sec-text">I joined eToro in 2024 as the Senior Product Manager for Banking &amp; Payments — responsible for the full money movement domain across a global trading platform serving millions of users. The domain covers deposit flows, withdrawal journeys, payment method management, and cross-border fund movements in multiple currencies and regulatory jurisdictions.</p>
      <p class="sec-text" style="margin-top:.75rem">My mandate was clear: reduce friction in payment flows, improve completion rates, establish a robust KPI framework, and modernize how the product team ships. I came in during a period of growth, which meant both opportunity and technical debt.</p>

        </ul>
        <ul class="learnings">
          <li class="l-item">Payment reliability is a product metric. Treating error rates and incident frequency as product KPIs — not just ops — means they get on the roadmap</li>
